# competetive_grind
Most of the problems I solved and algorithms I grinded while prepairing for Russian Olympiad in Informatics.
Solutions from about 2017 to 2019. 
Inludes some advanced algorithms and data structures such as persistent segment trees, treaps, heavy-light decompositions, centroid decompositions and other. So you may find their implementation if you search well enough.
